Let's face it: traditional technical interviews like leetcode-style challenges can feel disconnected from real-world software development. They often focus more on memorization of algorithms than on the practical, collaborative skills engineers use every day.

But lately, I've noticed a shift in how some companies are approaching the hiring process. Take-home projects paired with a follow-up interview are becoming more common, and it's a trend I hope continues.

## Here's why I love this approach:

<div className="mb-4 flex justify-center">
    <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4">
        <div className="rounded-lg p-4 border-2 border-sky-700">
            ### 1. It's more realistic

            Take-home projects mirror the actual work engineers do, focusing on problem-solving and implementation rather than obscure coding puzzles.
        </div>
        <div className="rounded-lg p-4 border-2 border-sky-700">
            ### 2. It levels the playing field

            Engineers who may not thrive under the pressure of a whiteboard interview still get to showcase their expertise in a more thoughtful, authentic way.

        <div className="rounded-lg p-4 border-2 border-sky-700">
            ### 3. It's collaborative

            Reviewing and discussing a candidate's solution in an interview provides deeper insight into their problem-solving process and how they approach challenges.

## What about for hiring managers?

For hiring managers, this approach isn't just kinder to candidates, it's smarter.

When I recently completed a take-home project as part of an interview, I realized how much valuable insight it provided about my decision-making process. In just a few hours, I had to make judgment calls that reflected the types of decisions engineers face every day:

<div className="mb-4 flex justify-center">
    <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4">
        <div className="rounded-lg p-4 border-2 border-slate-500">
            ### Technology selection

            Which frameworks or libraries best solve the problem?
        </div>
        <div className="rounded-lg p-4 border-2 border-slate-500">
            ### Design trade-offs

            How should components be split, endpoints structured, or data modeled for scalability?
        </div>
        <div className="rounded-lg p-4 border-2 border-slate-500">
            ### Time management

            How do I balance UX, architecture, and functionality within a limited timeframe?
        </div>
    </div>

</div>

Even in a simplified project, there was nuance in every choice. If I had been the interviewer, these decisions would have been a goldmine for understanding the candidate's skills, critical thinking, and approach to iterative, pragmatic development.

## Winning formula for everyone

I get it...not every company has the resources to design and evaluate take-home projects effectively. It's a significant investment. But for those that do, the payoff is clear: they attract talented, motivated engineers who appreciate the opportunity to prove their abilities in a meaningful way.

Take-home assessments are a win-win: better experiences for candidates, deeper insights for hiring managers, and ultimately stronger, more collaborative engineering teams.

More of this, please.
