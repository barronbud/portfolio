I always want to hire a great engineer. Who doesn't? I need a no-BS 360° view of their skills to make that a reality. Technical and team interviews are the best way to achieve it.

I use common ingredients to make my own special brand of interviews—a dash of technical assessment, a sprinkle of cross team collaboration. The specifics differ from company to company, but usually include:

-   One low-stress technical assessment—I hate leetcode nonsense, so either pair programming or a take-home project with review
-   One or more interviews with co-workers across engineering, product, and design

I typically don't attend all these interviews, so I need to know:

-   What is their collaboration style? Can it mesh with our team?
-   Are they good at communicating effectively?
-   Do their technical chops match what we need?

My goal is to boil it down to two key questions: "Can we successfully work with this person?" and "What would this person add to the team?"

I'm not huge on the "anything but a strong yes is a no" mentality. There is just too much room between a strong yes and strong no. A person can have a bad interview for any number of reasons.

Maybe they get nervous and stressed during interviews
Maybe they are distracted by life outside the interview
Maybe they have a style or personality that's unique or different

I've been, and done, all of those when interviewing. I know it's damn hard to perfectly stick the landing.

So when I make a go/no-go call after an interview, I treat it like the final round in "Chopped". Yes, I review the feedback from their recent interview. But only within the context of ALL their interviews.

I'll gladly take a strong yes or strong no. But if not, I still want to get an accurate assessment of the person, even if it's harder to do.

That's the way I meet my goal of hiring the best engineer I can find.
