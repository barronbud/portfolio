# How I Hire: Making the Final Decision

It all comes down to this. I've reviewed resumes, completed interviews, and collected feedback. But now...now I need to make a decision.

I feel the gravity of this decision every time. I'm holding the hopes and dreams of anxious candidates in my hands. It's not an easy decision, nor should it be.

At this point I go back to first principles. I need confidence in my decision; that starts with challenging my assumptions.

I review the resume.
I re-read ALL of the feedback.
I delve into my notes and recollections.
I ask follow-ups of the hiring team to get more context.

I'm looking specifically at how well candidates demonstrated their non-technical skills. I can train and bridge most technical gaps; it's harder to improve rough communication and collaboration skills.

It's not that I don't care about technical skill. I do. Very much. Bonnie is correct in her posts...been there, done that experience is simply more valuable, especially in a competitive market.

But having technical chops just isn't enough. I need candidates to mesh well with the wider team AND bring their unique skills and perspective.

Best case scenario I have at least one clear choice at the end of my review. That's my goal. I can make their week and gain a new member of my team.

However, unless I have a Netflix-style "Keeper Test", I need to be willing to restart the entire process if needed. If I select the wrong candidate it'll end up being more wasteful than going back to square one.

My final decision is stressful. But it's absolutely worth it to pick a great candidate.
