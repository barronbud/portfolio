Congratulations! Your engineering team has grown to the point where they must take on more engineers to simply keep up with maintenance demand, let alone tackling the tsunami of new features being requested. Each new team member adds additional overhead, communication becomes harder, and you have to find a way to make things more efficient.

## The Trap

After reviewing your growing team you notice really good engineers who excel at front-end work (HTML, CSS, JS), some that are amazing at backend systems, and a few in-between. “I’ll create two teams — one for front-end work and another for backend development” you think. “Similar skill sets will be together and everything will be great!”

> Wrong.

While you’ve done a great job assessing your **_team_**, you fallen into the trap of not reviewing your current portfolio of products _or_ forecasting the types of work your new teams will be tasked with over the next 12–18 months. You now have no clue if you’ve set them up for success or failure because you can’t say if their work will be isolated or inter-connected. Lacking this awareness of the field your engineers will be operating on is a crucial mistake.

If you’re lucky, your oversight will cause minimal issues with shipping features. Or maybe you can compensate with Herculean efforts using project management and coordination. If you are unlucky, you’ve just screwed your teams, limited their throughput, and decreased your reliability and consistency.

## The Problem

Even though your engineering organization is growing, your project management approaches, communication channels, and workflows may not have followed suit. A backend/front-end split can, and does, work, but it often requires a maturity level your new teams probably aren’t ready to pull off quite yet.

If your products are still tightly coupled, when your stakeholders request new features requiring multiple tiers of your stack — say a new payment type for your application — the separation of your teams into focus areas can create inefficiencies. Any change in requirements will ripple through multiple teams, creating additional work, and creating blockers between them as one team waits on another.

This problem doesn’t magically stop after a feature is launched. When a bug is discovered, you are lucky if it can be isolated to just a single team. Now a bug report has to be completed for multiple teams, code has to be written across multiple codebases, and depending on the sophistication of your original implementation, you may have to coordinate deployment as well.

Instead of an internal discussion you’ve used previously, you now must coordinate work across two or more teams using some type of project management process or creation of architectural documentation (i.e. contracts via API). If you don’t, the requested feature will take longer than expected, the project will be delayed, all due to a core problem having nothing to do with the complexity of the feature being requested.

## A Better Way

In agile terms, the original sin is the creation of teams unable to operate autonomously, that are focused too narrowly on _their_ speciality, and the creation of dependencies between teams that must be managed. A better way is to avoid the dependency in the first place.

-   Break away from backend/front-end functional teams by using cross-functional product teams who have a mixture of skills (back and front).
-   Empower teams with full autonomy over their product(s).
-   Mature your architecture and processes to adapt to, and support, this new orientation.

Perhaps your organization is too small or your product portfolio is too large to setup true long-term, cross-functional teams focused on products. Instead try utilizing project teams that live for the duration of the project, disbanding at the end of a successful launch. While you can’t ride this approach forever, it _can_ be a bridge between skill teams and product teams, by making a few rest stops with project teams. This will help your engineers start to think about the success of a product first instead of the walls between pieces and teams of that product.

## But…but…but

> “But my engineers are not cross-functional — they have specific strengths and can’t work on everything!”

As with many things, Mike Cohn has already addressed this concern by highlighting that [while “multi-skilled” engineers are preferred, specialists are fine.](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/cross-functional-doesnt-mean-everyone-can-do-everything) In the end, it’s the **_team_** that should ultimately be cross-functional, not every single member of that team. That said, your engineers are probably more adaptable than you give them credit for. Give them the opportunity to try out new things in a safe, supportive, collaborative environment and see if they don’t surprise you.

> “Sure, but how will I improve the skills of my engineers if they don’t work with
> other people with the same skills? Iron sharpens iron!”

There are a number of ways to do this that have minimal effect on the shipment of features — regular engineering discussions, baseline standards and approaches, technical talks (lightning or otherwise), architectural deep dives, etc. Taken to an extreme you may end up implementing something akin to [Spotify’s idea of “Chapters”](http://blog.crisp.se/2012/11/14/henrikkniberg/scaling-agile-at-spotify) where similar engineers are grouped across team boundaries and it’s their responsibility to organize and associate amongst themselves.

> “How will I determine the performance of the engineers I oversee if I don’t have
> them all in one team?”

The key is attempting to separate _reporting lines_ from _team structure_ and the product/projects they oversee. Sure, you may have supervisors mentoring engineers across multiple teams. But this ensures that your engineers look to the right authority for guidance — your Product Owner (or equivalent) for their daily work; their supervisor for mentorship and career growth. Differentiation between types of focus (career growth vs. product/project) is healthy and often necessary.

## One Size Fits All?

Does this mean having backend and front-end teams is always wrong? Absolutely not. In many cases, this type of team structure can be incredibly successful — but it requires all of your support systems (leadership, project management, technology) to be aligned to meet the task of coordination. And it **_has_** to be done intentionally with an eye towards how and what your engineering organization develops. Otherwise, you are likely setting your teams up for frustrating failures they can’t easily fix.
